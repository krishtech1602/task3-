# Linear Regression – House Price Prediction  

##  Project Overview  
This project implements **Simple & Multiple Linear Regression** using the **Housing Price Prediction dataset**.  
The objective is to understand the working of linear regression, interpret coefficients, and evaluate model performance using regression metrics.

##  Steps Performed  
1. Imported and preprocessed the dataset (Housing Price Prediction)  
2. Split the data into **training** and **testing** sets  
3. Trained a **Linear Regression model** using `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`  
4. Evaluated the model using:  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R² Score  
5. Plotted regression line(s) and interpreted coefficients

##  Results  
- Learned the relationship between **independent variables** (e.g., Area, Bedrooms) and **Price**  
- Model coefficients give the weight/importance of each feature  
- Evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²) helped check model performance
